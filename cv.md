**Kata Trainer from CODEWARS:**
Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0. Your function only needs to return the result.
```
var summation = function (num) {
  let sum=0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    sum += i;
  }
  return sum
}
